# Data-Modeling-with-Cassandra-Sparkify-ETL

## Introduction

a startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

## Role Description

we will create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions, we 'll be able to test the database by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify to create the results,  we will crreate an ETL pipeline that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.

    
## Description of files in the repository

### event_data
contains CSV files that we will extract the data from (our Data source).

### ETL_Pipeline.ipynb
a notebook that contains our etl process and CQL Commands to create table and query data in Apache Cassandra.
